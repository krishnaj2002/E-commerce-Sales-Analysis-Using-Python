 E-commerce Sales and Profit Analysis Using Python

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of an E-commerce store's sales and profitability using Python. The dataset comprised 820,648 transactions, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of key performance metrics. The analysis included:  

1️⃣ **Monthly Sales Analysis – Identified months with the highest and lowest sales trends.  
2️⃣ **Product Category-wise Sales Analysis** – Assessed sales distribution across different product categories.  
3️⃣ **Product-wise Sales Analysis** – Evaluated individual product performance based on sales volume.  
4️⃣ **Monthly Profit Analysis** – Examined profitability fluctuations across different months.  
5️⃣ **Profit by Category** – Analyzed profit contributions from various product categories.  

This analysis provided valuable insights into **sales trends, product performance, and profitability**, helping optimize business strategies for revenue growth and operational efficiency.
